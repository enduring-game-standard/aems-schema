## The Problem

Game entities die with the studios that create them. When a server shuts down, a player's inventory vanishes. When a publisher discontinues a title, the characters, weapons, and currencies that players invested hundreds of hours acquiring become inaccessible. Blockchain-based approaches introduced token-based ownership but brought their own fragilities: discretionary supply, platform-dependent liquidity, and reliance on specific chains that may themselves disappear.

AEMS takes a different approach. It defines game entities as plain, signed Nostr events that persist on open relays without fees, chains, or central authorities. Entities are structured in four layers that separate the universal concept from its game-specific interpretation, player ownership, and mutable state. The result is a minimal protocol for game entities that any client can read, any game can import, and any community can maintain — regardless of whether the original creator is still operating.

---

## Core Premise

A sword is not a product. It is a concept that predates any game containing it. Every RPG that features swords shares an archetype; what differs is the interpretation. The same is true of health potions, playing cards, chess pieces, and every other entity that appears across multiple games.

AEMS treats game entities as community-defined roles rather than author-locked tokens. A "Health Potion" is a universal role — a named concept — that anyone can publish and any game can reference. Dark Souls interprets it as an Estus Flask. Final Fantasy VII interprets it as a Potion. Minecraft interprets it as a Splash Potion. Each interpretation is a game-specific Manifestation of the same underlying Entity. The role belongs to no one and is available to everyone.

This is possible because AEMS entities are [Nostr](https://nostr.com) events — published to open relays, discoverable by anyone with a relay connection, forkable without permission, and persistent without any single relay's cooperation. Nostr is not an implementation detail. It is the commons that makes AEMS entities findable, composable, and durable. The same properties that make Nostr a credible social protocol — cryptographic identity, relay-distributed persistence, plain-text readability — make it a credible substrate for game entities that must outlast their creators.

---

## A Concrete Example

A community publishes a **Sword** Entity event to Nostr relays: a universal archetype with a name, category, and description. The Entity belongs to no studio. Anyone can discover it by querying relays for Entity events.

Studio A builds an action RPG and publishes a **Manifestation** of the Sword Entity: a "Flameblade" with 120 base damage, a fire enchantment, and custom visual properties specific to their game. Studio B builds a survival game and publishes a different Manifestation of the same Sword Entity: a "Rustic Blade" with durability mechanics and crafting requirements. Both Manifestations reference the same underlying Entity.

A player in Studio A's game earns a Flameblade by completing a quest. The game publishes an **Asset** event signed by the player's Nostr keypair, recording ownership of that specific instance.

Studio A closes. Its servers go dark.

The player's Asset event is still on Nostr relays. Studio B's game can read it, recognize the Sword Entity reference, and offer the player an equivalent Rustic Blade, or a community-built client can display the full provenance chain: Entity → Manifestation → Asset. The player's item persists because it was never stored on Studio A's servers. It was published to a commons that no single party controls.

---

## The Four Layers

AEMS defines a four-layer hierarchy. Each layer is a Nostr addressable event with its own dedicated event kind, identified by its publisher's public key and a `d`-tag.

> **Note**: The concrete Nostr kind numbers are deliberately not yet assigned. Allocations are deferred until they are formalized against real relay usage; until then, examples use named placeholders such as `"<AEMS Entity kind>"`.

```
Entity → Manifestation → Asset → State
  ↓           ↓            ↓        ↓
universal   game-spec    player    mutable
archetype   interpret    instance  condition
```

### Entity

A **named role** — an IP-agnostic concept that exists independently of any game. Entities are maintained by communities, not studios. An Entity names what something IS in universal terms: "Sword," "Health Potion," "Monster." Any Nostr user can publish an Entity; the protocol imposes no registry and no gatekeeping. Entities carry no grouping tags — only a `d`-tag identifier, a human-readable `name`, and a plain-language description.

```json
{
  "kind": "<AEMS Entity kind>",
  "pubkey": "...",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "health-potion"],
    ["name", "Health Potion"]
  ],
  "content": {
    "description": "Restores vitality when used"
  }
}
```

Entities use parameterized replacement: for a given `pubkey` and `d`-tag, relays store only the latest version, allowing community evolution without losing identity.

### Manifestation

A **game-specific implementation** of one or more Entities. How a particular game interprets, expresses, and balances the universal role. Every Manifestation MUST include at least one `entity` tag referencing a parent Entity. A Manifestation may reference multiple Entities, declaring all the roles the game object participates in.

A Manifestation is the layer that a RUNS build process compiles into type definitions: it provides the concrete properties that Processors act on at runtime. Manifestations are resolved at build time, not queried per-frame.

```json
{
  "kind": "<AEMS Manifestation kind>",
  "pubkey": "...",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "rpg-adventure:potion"],
    ["entity", "<entity_event_id>", "health-potion"],
    ["category", "consumable"],
    ["type", "healing"],
    ["property", "restore_amount", "100", "integer"],
    ["property", "stack_limit", "50", "integer"]
  ],
  "content": {
    "game": "RPG Adventure",
    "name": "Vitality Elixir"
  }
}
```

Different games create different Manifestations of the same Entity. A "Health Potion" Entity might become a "Flask" in Dark Souls, a "Potion" in Final Fantasy VII, or a "Splash Potion" in Minecraft. Each Manifestation inherits the archetype and adapts it.

### Asset

A **player-owned instance** of a Manifestation. When a player acquires an item, they publish an Asset event signed by their own Nostr keypair, claiming ownership of that specific instance. The Asset persists on relays regardless of whether the game's servers continue operating.

Every Asset MUST include a `manifestation` tag referencing the parent Manifestation.

```json
{
  "kind": "<AEMS Asset kind>",
  "pubkey": "<owner_pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "instance-7f3a9b2c"],
    ["manifestation", "<manifestation_id>", "rpg-adventure:potion"],
    ["acquired", "1706886400"]
  ],
  "content": {}
}
```

**Ownership transfers** are accomplished by the new owner publishing an updated Asset event with the same `d`-tag, referencing the previous owner for provenance:

```json
{
  "kind": "<AEMS Asset kind>",
  "pubkey": "<new_owner_pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "instance-7f3a9b2c"],
    ["manifestation", "<manifestation_id>", "rpg-adventure:potion"],
    ["prev_owner", "<old_owner_pubkey>"],
    ["e", "<previous_asset_event_id>"]
  ],
  "content": {}
}
```

### State

**Mutable condition** of a specific Asset. State captures current hit points, remaining charges, enchantments, wear, or any other property that changes during play. State is deliberately separated from identity: the Asset records *what you own*; the State records *what condition it is in*.

Every State event MUST include an `asset` tag referencing the parent Asset.

```json
{
  "kind": "<AEMS State kind>",
  "pubkey": "...",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "instance-7f3a9b2c"],
    ["asset", "<asset_event_id>", "instance-7f3a9b2c"],
    ["property", "charges_remaining", "3", "integer"],
    ["property", "condition", "0.75", "float"],
    ["property", "custom_paint", "daughter-art-2026", "string"]
  ],
  "content": {}
}
```

State is updated by publishing new events. The most recent event for a given `d`-tag represents the current condition.

## What AEMS Deliberately Excludes

AEMS is deliberately minimal. It defines four event kinds, their structural relationships, and nothing more. This restraint ensures AEMS remains neutral infrastructure, not a platform.

| Excluded | Why | Where It Belongs |
|----------|-----|------------------|
| Databases/indexing | Protocol defines structure, not storage | Relay operators, clients |
| Marketplaces | Protocol enables transfers, not commerce | Third-party platforms, coordination layers |
| Validation logic | Protocol defines events, not rules | Game-specific Manifestations |
| Rendering | Protocol describes entities, not how they look | Game clients, visual engines |
| Namespacing/registries | Protocol is permissionless | Community convention, reputation |
| Rich metadata standards | Protocol is minimal | [AEMS Conventions](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/aems-conventions), application-layer schemas |
| Composites/hierarchies | Protocol defines atoms, not molecules | Application-layer composition |

Higher-layer conventions — visual properties, composition rules, domain-specific schemas — belong in separate, optional community profiles. The [AEMS Conventions](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/aems-conventions) companion provides recommended community conventions for interoperable implementations, including universal tag conventions (mandatory `entity` tags, namespacing via `d`-tags, consistent property naming), the IP Boundary Principle, and domain-specific examples.

The boundary: the **standard** defines the four event kinds and their structural relationships. **Conventions** recommend how to use them interoperably. If a detail concerns *what games should agree on* rather than *what the protocol requires*, it belongs in conventions.

## Ecosystem Connections

AEMS is one protocol in a four-protocol architecture. Each protocol handles a different structural concern:

### AEMS → RUNS

AEMS defines the *things*. [RUNS](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/runs-spec) defines the *game* — the composable source that implements how things behave. At build time, AEMS Manifestations are compiled into type definitions and lookup tables that Processors reference. At load/save boundaries, AEMS Asset and State events persist player data to the commons. The relationship spans the full lifecycle: AEMS provides the entity definitions that RUNS source implements, and the persistence layer that preserves player state across sessions.

### AEMS → WOCS

[WOCS](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/wocs-protocol) coordinates the *infrastructure* that sustains the ecosystem — server hosting, anti-cheat services, asset creation, tournament pooling, and any other coordination need. AEMS answers "what are the things?" WOCS answers "who coordinates the work that keeps the ecosystem running?"

### AEMS → MAPS

[MAPS Notation](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/maps-notation) describes the *rules* of game mechanics. Where AEMS Entities define named roles (a sword, a monster), MAPS patterns describe the structural relationships those roles participate in (a resource-acquire pattern, a locked-transition arc). A designer notates the mechanical grammar in MAPS and instantiates the things in AEMS. Because both are open and discoverable, designers can study, fork, and extend each other's work across generations.

### Why Nostr

Nostr is not an interchangeable transport layer. It is the commons infrastructure that gives AEMS its structural properties. Entities published to Nostr relays are discoverable by anyone with a relay connection, forkable by anyone with a signing key, and persistent across relay redundancy without requiring any single operator's cooperation. These properties — permissionless discovery, cryptographic ownership, distributed persistence — are what make AEMS entities durable community infrastructure rather than another proprietary database.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Define an Entity** — Publish an Entity event to any Nostr relay. Use a descriptive `d`-tag as the identifier.
2. **Discover Entities** — Query relays for Entity events to find universal archetypes published by the community.
3. **Create a Manifestation** — Publish a Manifestation event referencing an Entity for your game, with game-specific properties.
4. **Claim an Asset** — When a player acquires an item, publish an Asset event signed by the player's keypair.
5. **Track State** — Update mutable properties via State events referencing the Asset.

For tag conventions, property naming patterns, and domain-specific examples, see [AEMS Conventions](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/aems-conventions).

## The Larger Vision

AEMS exists because game entities should outlast the studios that create them. When a player earns a sword, that sword should persist the way a physical chess piece persists — not because a server keeps running, but because the entity was published to a commons that anyone can read and no one controls. And when a future game recognizes that sword's Entity reference and says "I know what a sword is," the item doesn't just survive — it transfers.

This dual purpose — preservation and portability — is one piece of a larger structural argument. Patient capital makes open protocols economically rational. Durable substrate ensures the artifacts survive. Cumulative craft transmits the knowledge of how to build them well. AEMS contributes to durable substrate: entities stored as open, readable events on a distributed commons, composable across games, maintainable by communities. For the full argument, see the [Enduring Game Standard overview](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard).
